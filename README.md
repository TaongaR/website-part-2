CSS Stylesheet        

-The css stylesheet provides a clean, accessible, and responsive foundation for the Medi-Hope Connect website. It includes typography, layout grid, navigation styles, color and decoration tokens, pseudo-class interactions, image treatments, and responsive adjustments for layout, typography, navigation, and images.

 Files
 styles.css â€” primary stylesheet implementing typography, layout, decoration, pseudo-classes, and responsive rules.

 Key Features
- Accessible typography: with readable defaults and modular heading scale.  
- Fluid grid layout: using CSS Grid with auto-fit and minmax for cards and content blocks.  
- Responsive navigation: that switches from horizontal to stacked layout on small screens.  
- Visual theme: using calming teal and soft neutrals with subtle gradients and shadows.  
- Interactive states: for links, buttons, and images using :hover and :focus for keyboard accessibility.  
- Responsive adjustments: for layout, font sizes, navigation and images at common breakpoints.

 Quick Install
1. Place styles.css in your project css folder.  
2. Link the stylesheet in your HTML head:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
```
3. Wrap page content in a `.container` and use `.grid` where a responsive card layout is required. Use semantic elements like `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, and `footer`.

 Usage Examples
- Container and grid
```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="grid">
    <section>Card 1</section>
    <section>Card 2</section>
    <section>Card 3</section>
  </div>
</div>
```
- Navigation
```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="/services">Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

 Accessibility Notes
- Color choices aim for sufficient contrast for body text and primary navigation.  
- Focusable elements include visible :focus styles through the navigation :focus rule and button hover/focus states.  
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA landmarks as needed to improve navigation for screen reader users.  
- Test final color combinations against WCAG guidelines and adjust variables if required.

Responsive Behavior
- Breakpoint at 768px reduces the base font size and stacks navigation vertically.  
- Breakpoint at 480px reduces heading sizes, tightens paddings, and simplifies spacing for small screens.  
- Images are fluid and scale using max-width 100% and height auto.

 Customization Guide
- Change primary color by replacing the teal hex values (`#00796b`, `#004d40`, `#e0f2f1`, `#b2dfdb`) with your preferred palette.  
- Swap fonts by editing `body` and heading font-family declarations. Include webfont links in HTML head if needed.  
- Adjust grid gap and min card width in `.grid` to alter density of responsive cards.

 Extensions and Components to Add
- Utility classes for spacing, helpers for visually-hidden content, and a variables section using CSS custom properties for easier theming.  
- Components for forms, modals, cards with image overlays, and an accessible mobile menu toggle.
